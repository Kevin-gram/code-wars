// Question 2: Object Property Shorthand
// You have the following variables:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const title = 'Engineer';
// const department = 'Engineering';
// const experience = 5;
// Write the code to create an object named job using the property shorthand notation that includes the title, department, and experience properties.
const title = 'Engineer';
const department = 'Engineering';
const experience = 5;
const job={
   title,
   department,
   experience
}
console.log(job);
